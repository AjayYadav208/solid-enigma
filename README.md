I have experience implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on both the MNIST and CIFAR datasets. For MNIST, a dataset of handwritten digits, I developed a CNN model to accurately classify digits. Similarly, for CIFAR, a dataset of color images, I designed a CNN architecture capable of effectively recognizing objects in images.
